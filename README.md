**Answer for C**
1.	A microwave in the apartment.

3.	Show a gif image of the control interface in operation.

4.	Issues with the current design and Explanation on why it is bad:
a.	I had to watch someone use the microwave before I knew how to operate it. Unlike my microwave back in Nigeria which just had 2 knobs (one that shows the timer and the other to show the level of heat). All I needed to do was to turn the knob below to set the timer. Or the knob above to select the level of heat I want in the food (e.g whether defrost or high heat) It was pretty easy to use for my everyday needs.

b.	The auto-cook functions are not easy to understand or use:

i.	The auto-cook functions were pretty hard to use. I had to press all kinds of things and played around with it before I figured out how it works.

ii.	When you eventually figure out what the purpose is for, because you are not able to set the time by yourself, it is either too low to make the food warm enough or too high and would dry the food out. For example, the bread function. Is it used to warm cold bread in the fridge or frozen bread or to bake bread? Or the Soup, is it for frozen soup or just cold soup?

c.	There is a button called power. I eventually guessed that is the part where you select the temperature/level of heat. This was not clear at first. It was in the process of doing this project I even discovered it. 



**Answer for B**
1.	Most common uses and other more rare uses of a microwave. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?

i.	I mostly warm food that I have refrigerated or food that I cooked but is already cold. Majorly any kind of food that is not hot, I put in the microwave to heat it up.

ii.	My most rarely used function is the auto-cook. I haven’t figured out how ALL the auto-cook functions work. So I just take a chance with setting the timer and checking from time to time so my food does not dry-out.

iii.	The interface doesn’t exactly make it easier. It actually takes watching someone use it before you know how to. But when you eventually do, it is quite straightforward.

2.	Think about how the user interacts with the microwave. What is the common sequence of actions?

The common sequence of action is to open the microwave, put in the item to be heated, and set the timer. As seen in the gif above.

3.	How does the microwave support the user figure out how to make it work?

--It really doesn’t. Especially if you don’t have the manual. You have to watch someone that is already familiar with it use it, or figure it out by pressing several buttons repeatedly till you figure it out. No feedback whatsoever as to what to do.

4.	How does the microwave provide feedback to the user?

--There’s a countdown for the timer to monitor the time, a sound goes off when it is done cooking for the set time and the light in the microwave goes off.

5.	What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
i.	You can press the auto-function button and still not know how to select the any of the menus listed on the panel. You’ll keep pressing 1 or 2 or 3 and just be frustrated. 

ii.	You can mistakenly press the power button, which may increase or reduce the temperature. Now, because you are used to the number of minutes used in heating up your food, its either you dry out the food or it’ll not be hot enough and it’ll take more time to heat up. 

iii. The screen is blank. no instruction as to what to do to get the timer started. You just guess by pressing numbers. 

6a.	Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution and justify your design decisions.
i.	My approach is to make the design as simple and as easy to use as possible. The major use of a microwave by most people is to heat up food. The goal is to make the user interface easy to use and understand for every first time user.

ii. I also provided feedback(instruction) as to what to do next(after putting the food in the microwave) to start the warming process. This way, there is no confusuion as to what to do next.

iii.	Remove the auto-function buttons and replace the functions with power options. The options are High, Medium or Defrost. This is pretty direct and straight forward. This is to avoid getting bombarded with a barage of choices thereby leaving you confused. 

iv.	Also, feedback to user should be improved. It should display a user-friendly message informing the user the food is ready. The light in the microwave should come on when the food begins to warm and go off with a sound when the light goes off. I also added an extra voice instruction telling the user the "Food is ready".

See below sketched solution:
